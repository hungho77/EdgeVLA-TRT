//! \brief The pi0.5 action expert: the flow-matching denoise loop over a K/V cache the
//! prefix tower has already filled, plus the cond component that hoists the AdaRMS
//! modulation out of that loop.
//!
//! The capture bakes in the batch, the step count and the K/V cache addresses, so generate()
//! drops a stale graph when any of those move. The prefix length is not among them: it
//! reaches only buffers that keep their addresses and are restaged before every launch.
//!
//! Single-stream by construction, NOT thread-safe.
