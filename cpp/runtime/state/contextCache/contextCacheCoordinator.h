//! The coordinator has no worker of its own; every call is made by the caller's thread and callers must keep those
//! calls serialized. Request handles may overlap in lifetime: several may be admitted and hold a page lease at once,
//! which is the ownership shape in-flight batching needs.
//!
//! Overlapping leases are not overlapping execution, and the distinction is load-bearing. Page-table rows bind to
//! stable physical resident slots, while request-local reuse-length staging is reused across preparations. A prepare
//! issued before the previous request's async copy has landed would corrupt that staging buffer. A caller must
//! therefore still finish one request's steps before preparing the next; what a count rather than a flag permits is
//! that the leases, not the execution, may interleave.
//!
//! Normal publication occurs only at host-visible completion points already present in the runtime. An abnormal exit
//! drains the bound stream before releasing active page references; a failed drain quarantines the entire request and
//! poisons the coordinator until runtime-owned shutdown can establish quiescence. Poisoning gates new admissions, so
//! a request already admitted when the stream failed is quarantined by its own drain rather than by the first
