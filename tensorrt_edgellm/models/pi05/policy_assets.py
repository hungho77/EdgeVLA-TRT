"""Runtime sidecars that turn the pi0.5 engines into a policy.

Two artifacts, both staged next to the engines by the builder:

* ``text_tokenizer/`` -- the PaliGemma tokenizer in HuggingFace form. The
  checkpoint names ``google/paligemma-3b-pt-224``, whose HF repo is gated; the
  identical SentencePiece model is served anonymously from ``big_vision`` and is
  what openpi itself loads, so it is converted here instead.
* ``policy.json`` -- the single policy manifest: the observation/action contract
  (feature dimensions, camera list, image resolution) plus the export identity
  that ties the component directories to one checkpoint. The shapes come from the
  checkpoint pins; every robot-facing dimension comes from
  ``OPENPI_POLICY_CONTRACTS``, keyed by the configuration name.
